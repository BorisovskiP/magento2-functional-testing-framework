# Interactive Pause

Itâ€™s hard to write a complete test at once. You will need to try different commands with different arguments before you find a correct path.

Since Codeception 3.0 you can pause execution in any point and enter interactive shell where you will be able to try commands in action. 

Now this `Interactive Pause` feature is available in MFTF and all you need to do is to set `ENABLE_PAUSE=true` in `.env`.

Check it out at [Codeception website][] for documentation and a video to see `Interactive Pause` in action.
 
In short, when a test gets to `$I->pause()` step, it stops and shows a console where you can try all available commands with auto-completion, stash commands, and save screenshot, etc. 

## Generation Time

A `<pause>` action in xml will always be generated into php regardless if `ENABLE_PAUSE=true` is set or not. 
However, when `ENABLE_PAUSE=true` is set, an additional`pause()` action will be generated in `_failed()` hook for a test,
so that the test could pause on failure at run time.

## Execution Time

To use `Interactive Pause` at run time, there are two types of MFTF commands to use.

### MFTF Run Commands

When `ENABLE_PAUSE=true` is set, the following MFTF run commands support `Interactive Pause`.

```bash
vendor/bin/mftf run:group
```

```bash
vendor/bin/mftf run:test
```

```bash
vendor/bin/mftf run:manifest
```

```bash
vendor/bin/mftf run:failed
```

<div class="bs-callout-warning">
Note: MFTF run command's `--debug` option is different from Codeception `--debug` mode option. 
</div>

### MFTF Codecept Run Command

You can also use MFTF's wrapper command to run Codeception directly and activate `Interactive Pause` by passing `--debug` option. 
You don't need to set `ENABLE_PAUSE=true` for this command.

```bash
vendor/bin/mftf codecept:run --debug
```
